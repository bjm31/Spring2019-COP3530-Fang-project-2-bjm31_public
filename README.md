## Project Outcomes:
Develop a C++ program that uses:
* {TOPICS}

## Preparatory Readings:
{READINGS}

## Background Information:
### Project overview:
{OVERVIEW}

### Project Requirements:
Your application must function as described below:
1. {REQUIREMENTS}

#### Sample data
```
{INPUT_FILE}
```

### Implementation Notes:
1. Create a project that is object oriented, therefore there should be several classes.
2. The input file will match the exact format given above.

### Submission Requirements:
1. All code must be added and commiitted to your local git repository.
2. All code must be pushed to the GitHub repository created when you "accepted" the assignment.
	1. After pushing, with `git push origin master`, visit the web URL of your repository to verify that your code is there.
	If you don't see the code there, then we can't see it either.
3. Your code must compile and run in Travis-CI or it might not be graded.
	1. The Travis-CI build should begin automatically when you push youur code to GitHub.
	2. If your program will not compile, the graders will not be responsible for trying to test it. 
	3. You should get an email regarding the status of your build, if it does not pass, keep trying.

## Important Notes:
* Projects will be graded on whether they correctly solve the problem, and whether they adhere to good programming practices. 
* Projects must be received by the time specified on the due date. Projects received after that time will get a grade of zero. 
* Please review the academic honesty policy.
	* Note that viewing another student's solution, whether in whole or in part, is considered academic dishonesty.
	* Also note that submitting code obtained through the Internet or other sources, whether in whole or in part, is considered academic dishonesty.
	* All programs submitted will be reviewed for evidence of academic dishonesty, and all violations will be handled accordingly.
